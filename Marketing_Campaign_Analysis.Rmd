# question to clarify: 

# Are there any assumptions we should make about the dataset (e.g., randomness, independence of samples)?

# Should we account for market size explicitly in our A/B testing, or focus solely on the effectiveness of promotions?
# Is there a specific way to interpret the "market size" variable in relation to promotions?

# Should adjustments for multiple comparisons (e.g., Bonferroni correction) be applied, or is it sufficient to report unadjusted p-values?

# Is it appropriate to include additional exploratory tests, such as ANOVA or regression analysis, to support the A/B testing?

# Should we explore interaction effects (e.g., promotion and market size) or keep the analysis simple?

# ANOVA Table

# Main Effect of Promotion:
# F(2,539)=49.611,p<0.001 (significant).
# Promotions significantly affect sales overall, confirming that certain promotions are more effective than others.

#Main Effect of Market Size:
#F(2,539)=337.136,p<0.001 (highly significant).
#Market size has a substantial impact on sales, with larger markets driving higher sales.

#Interaction Effect (Promotion × Market Size):
#F(4,539)=4.586,p=0.001 (significant).
#The effectiveness of promotions depends on the market size, indicating that promotion performance varies across small, medium, and large markets.
```

```{r}
# Promotion Effect
#Promotion 2 vs. Promotion 1:
#Difference: −10.77 (significant)
#Promotion 1 significantly outperforms Promotion 2.

#Promotion 3 vs. Promotion 1:
#Difference: −2.73 (significant)
#Promotion 1 slightly outperforms Promotion 3, but the difference is small.

#Promotion 3 vs. Promotion 2:
#Difference: +8.03(significant)
#Promotion 3 significantly outperforms Promotion 2.



#Market Size Effect
#Medium vs. Large:
#Difference: −26.39 (significant)
#Large markets significantly outperform medium markets.

#Small vs. Large:
#Difference: −13.63 (significant, 
#Large markets significantly outperform small markets.

#Small vs. Medium:
#Difference: +12.76 (significant, 
#Medium markets significantly outperform small markets.


# Interaction Effect (Promotion × Market Size)
#Key Comparisons:
  
#Promotion 2 in large markets performs −14.91 lower than Promotion 1 in large markets
#Promotion 3 in large markets is similar to Promotion 1 in large markets

#In medium markets:
#Promotion 3 performs better than Promotion 2
#Promotion 1 outperforms Promotion 2.

#In small markets:
#Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 perform similarly, but both significantly outperform Promotion 2.


# Promotion Effectiveness:
#Promotion 3 is consistently better than Promotion 2 across all market sizes.
#Promotion 1 is slightly better than Promotion 3 overall, but the difference is marginal.

#Market Size Impact:
#Large markets generate the highest sales, followed by medium and small markets.
#The relative effectiveness of promotions is consistent across market sizes, but differences are more pronounced in medium and small markets.

#Interaction Effects:
#The choice of promotion matters most in medium and small markets.
#In large markets, Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 perform similarly, making either a viable choice.
